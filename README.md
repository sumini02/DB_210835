1. Implement the designed database with SQL
 
2. You are required to create some records in your tables: at least 10 records for each table. 

3. Create SQL queries for the followings task and store them according to the names given below. For example, QB3i (NOTE: You are advised to write SQL Script rather than generating using Query Designer): 

i. (QB3i) - List the all chatrooms available in PSB Academy and its full details.
 
ii. (QB3ii) - List down all group meetings which were held in year 2021 

iii. (QB3iii) - List down student name and chatroom they are joining. Sort the result by student name in descending order 

iv. (QB3iv) - List down all students who joined more than one chatroom 

v. (QB3v) - List down all group meetings, chatroom in which the meeting was scheduled, start date, end date, and total number of attendances. 

vi. (QB3vi) - For each program, list down total number of students who happen to be chatroom owner. 

vii. (QB3vii) - Develop a query to list down member of one chatroom containing the members details like name, email, program and role in the chatroom (label as member if the student is not assigned a role in chatroom). This query should allow user to enter which chatroom they want to generate the list using chatroom code.
